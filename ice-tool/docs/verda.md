# Verda GPU VMs

Ice supports ordinary on-demand NVIDIA GPU VMs through the Verda v1 API. The
Verda CLI is not required. Supported commands are `login`, `catalog`,
`create --ssh`, `list`, `shell --print-creds`, `push`, `pull`, `start`, `stop`,
and `delete`. Interactive SSH also works. Container/Arca/unpack deployment and
managed workload logs are unsupported and fail explicitly.

## Credentials and discovery

Run this in a terminal to set up persistent credentials:

```sh
ice login --cloud verda
```

Ice opens the Verda console. Select **Credentials → Cloud API credentials →
Create**, then paste the Client ID and Client Secret at Ice's prompts. Both inputs
are hidden. Ice validates the pair with Verda before saving it under
`auth.verda.client_id` and `auth.verda.client_secret` in its config (normally
`~/.config/ice/config.toml` on Linux). The file stores credentials as plaintext
with owner-only permissions on Unix. Config display redacts both values.

Subsequent commands reuse the saved pair. `ice login --cloud verda --force`
prompts for replacements; cancellation or failed validation leaves the saved pair
unchanged. Vast and Verda share this login policy and persistence mechanism.

For automation, provide both `VERDA_CLIENT_ID` and `VERDA_CLIENT_SECRET` through
your secret manager or shell environment, or use the saved configuration.
Environment credentials take precedence even with `--force`, are validated
without prompts and are never saved. An incomplete environment pair fails
instead of mixing it with saved credentials. To replace saved credentials, unset
both environment variables before using `--force`. Noninteractive login never
opens a browser or prompts; `--force` without environment credentials requires
interactive input. Ice exchanges credentials for a short-lived OAuth token held
only in memory.

```sh
ice login --cloud verda --non-interactive --json
ice catalog --cloud verda --non-interactive --json
```

`catalog` returns live machine types, supported image types, image IDs,
availability by location, and volume prices. It includes unavailable types for
discovery; `create` intersects the catalog with current on-demand availability.
Ice reports infrastructure capabilities; application and GPU-tool validation belong to the caller.

Register your SSH public key in Verda before creating a VM. Supply its ID with
`--ssh-key-id` or `default.verda.ssh_key_id`. Before creating a billable VM, Ice
reads that key and matches its public material to an existing local or agent key.
It does not upload or modify keys. For a specific private key:

```sh
ice config set default.verda.ssh_key_id=YOUR_REGISTERED_KEY_UUID
ice config set default.verda.ssh_key_path=/absolute/path/to/private-key
```

Actual creation checks for a missing/invalid SSH key UUID and an unavailable
configured private-key file before authenticating or discovering offers. Errors
identify the flag/config key and report `resource_created: false`. A dry-run
quote does not require an SSH key or local private key; authenticated catalog
access is still required. Matching the registered public key to a usable local
identity remains a required check before a billable create request.

Without a configured path, Ice searches local key pairs and then ssh-agent for a
matching key, rather than picking the first unrelated local identity. Local
checks have a ten-second budget. Keep `ssh-keygen` available; encrypted/hardware
keys need their `.pub` counterpart and a matching identity loaded with `ssh-add`,
or a matching agent-only identity when no path is configured. An explicit wrong
key path fails instead of silently selecting another key. Existing VM connection
and transfer commands use the VM's registered key IDs when available.

SSH uses root, batch authentication and `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new`.
The local OpenSSH availability check uses `ssh -V` (not `--version`).
Readiness uses the same bounded authentication probe as Vast. Connection refusal,
reset and similar transport failures retry within the startup deadline;
authentication, host-key, local-setup and unknown failures stop immediately with
structured diagnostics. Ice does not rewrite `known_hosts` to bypass a mismatch.

## Preview and create

```sh
ice create --cloud verda --ssh --gpu-count 1 --min-gpu-memory-gb 48 \
  --image IMAGE_TYPE_OR_UUID --disk-gb 100 --max-price-per-hr 1 --hours 0.25 \
  --no-defaults --non-interactive --dry-run --json
```

The limits above are examples, not a current offer or spending authorization.
`--gpu` matches the catalog's model/name, case-insensitively; `--machine` pins
an exact instance type. `--min-cpus`, `--min-ram-gb`, GPU count and per-GPU memory
are enforced. Verda's catalog VRAM is the total across all GPUs; Ice divides by
GPU count for `--min-gpu-memory-gb` and reports `offer.gpu_memory_per_gpu_gb`.
Host internet-speed filters are rejected because the catalog
does not supply measured rates. CPU-only, bare-metal and confidential-computing
configurations are outside this adapter's initial creation scope.

An explicit image is required: use `--image IMAGE_TYPE_OR_UUID` or save
`default.verda.image`. Discover values using `ice catalog --cloud verda --json`.
Ice checks that the selected ordinary image is in the machine's `supported_os`
list and submits its exact catalog UUID. Missing, ambiguous or incompatible
selections fail before purchase. There is no implicit newest-image, Ubuntu or
CUDA-version preference. Cluster/Kubernetes and confidential-computing images
remain excluded. Use `--location` or `default.verda.location` to constrain location.
Compatibility metadata does not prove installed software or workload readiness.

### Image provisioning and short rentals

Verda's [create API](https://api.verda.com/v1/docs) provisions an OS boot volume
from a provider image; `--image` does not upload an image from your computer or
ask the VM to pull a container registry image. Ice currently accepts advertised
catalog images only, not custom retained OS volumes. Choose a stock image that
already contains your required tools to avoid installing them on every rental.
An image UUID identifies the catalog choice, not a measured filesystem digest.

The [VM setup guide](https://docs.verda.com/cpu-and-gpu-instances/set-up-a-gpu-instance/)
describes provisioning in minutes. The reviewed documentation does not specify
per-image boot latency, cache placement or whether image preparation involves
internal copying. Do not assume zero image-transfer time. Any downloads you run
after boot still depend on the VM's network and the download source. Ice cannot
filter Verda by network speed because its catalog does not expose measurements.

Ice overlaps four independent catalog reads and reuses that snapshot during
selection, then refreshes once immediately before purchase. It neither installs
a workload toolkit nor runs a workload validation during creation. Successful
Verda creation returns `timings_ms` for discovery, preflight/confirmation,
create request, readiness, and total time. Readiness includes VM startup and an
SSH authentication check; it is not an image-only download measurement. The
preflight bucket includes human confirmation time if interactive.

The separately authorised 1 October Ada trial took approximately 74 seconds from
the provider's `created_at` timestamp to Ice command completion with SSH ready.
That is one historical observation on Ubuntu 26.04/CUDA 13.2, not an SLA or a
comparison of image choices. Image-size/cache effects need a separately authorised
measurement; these changes do not launch a trial.

`no_matching_offers` includes counts by the first failing selection stage:
resources/price, compatible image, or availability/location. It is not by itself
proof that the provider has no capacity.

The default boot disk is **100 GB**, priced as NVMe. `--disk-gb` changes both the
quoted size and the creation request. The API image catalog does not expose a
minimum disk size: this default follows the provider's CLI example, and neither
the catalog nor a preview guarantees every disk size is accepted. The separately
authorised Ada trial used 100 GB successfully; smaller overrides remain unverified.

`--max-price-per-hr` covers **compute plus the allocated OS disk** in USD. Storage
uses Verda CLI's conversion: monthly USD/GB × disk GB ÷ 730, rounded up to four
decimal places after multiplication. Unknown/invalid prices or non-USD storage
quotes fail. Bandwidth and taxes are excluded. Quotes are estimates, not an
invoice or prepaid-balance requirement; Verda documents advance billing in
10-minute increments with unused portions refunded after deletion.

Saved search settings live under `default.verda.*` in the standard Ice config.
JSON reports effective filters and their sources. `--no-defaults` ignores saved
resource filters, disk size, image and location; credentials and SSH key settings
remain usable. Creation does not save the invocation's selections.

For an authorized rental, replace `--dry-run` with
`--yes --manual-cleanup --startup-timeout 5m`. Ice refreshes availability,
image compatibility and the storage-inclusive quote immediately before creation.
A price increase since confirmation fails instead of silently accepting it.
The API offers no atomic price reservation; a preview does not reserve capacity.
Startup waits for both `running` and successful SSH authentication within one
readiness budget. Creation itself is a separate, bounded API request.

## Deadlines, failures and deletion

**There is no automatic stop or deletion in this adapter.** `--hours` supplies a
cost estimate and `cleanup.planned_deadline_unix`, not an enforced deadline.
Actual creation requires `--manual-cleanup`, including with `--yes`. Coordinate
an independent deadline/deletion guard before a paid trial and verify cleanup.
The JSON receipt reports `deadline_enforced: false`, `automatic_stop: false`,
and `automatic_delete: false`.

Verda `stop` means `shutdown`: **compute and storage billing continue** while
the VM is offline. `start` maps to `start`; it does not create a new deadline.
Use `delete` to end compute billing. Ice requests permanent deletion of the
selected VM's OS volume and verifies that the VM and OS volume are absent,
or have exact-ID terminal records (`discontinued` for the VM; `deleted` with
`is_permanently_deleted: true` for its OS volume). Both paths also require absence
from the paginated active-instance/volume lists and volume trash. Additional attached volumes are retained and
listed under `storage.retained_volume_ids`; they may continue to incur storage charges.
If the OS volume ID is unavailable, the receipt explicitly marks storage
cleanup as unknown. Inspect and remove remaining storage through Verda.

Create accepts a plain UUID, JSON UUID string, or JSON object with an `id`.
The plain-text exception is restricted to successful instance creation responses.
Create POSTs are never replayed automatically. If the response is lost or unusable, errors
include the generated hostname for reconciliation using `ice list` or the
Verda console. Once an ID is returned, recovery details preserve it and any
observed OS/attached volume IDs, plus a cleanup command. A startup failure leaves
the VM billable; it does not imply a stop or deletion. Inspect that resource
before retrying creation. Start/stop/delete accept `--timeout` (default `5m`) covering provider requests
and state verification. A deletion timeout is also an unverified outcome;
inspect the returned VM/volume IDs rather than assuming billing ended.

An ambiguous or rejected delete receipt triggers bounded read-only reconciliation,
never a repeated mutation. Success requires all the resource checks above, and
reports `request: "unconfirmed"` with `provider_details.action_receipt_confirmed: false`
and sanitized `provider_details.action_error` diagnostics
when reconciliation establishes deletion despite that receipt. An unverified result
retains the VM/OS/attached-volume IDs and both action and verification diagnostics.
Receipt diagnostics preserve types, field presence, row counts and ID/action
comparisons; arbitrary provider strings and unknown field names are not printed.

Safe API reads retry transient transport failures and HTTP 408/429/500/502/503/504
up to six attempts within the original request deadline. `Retry-After` is
honoured in full: if the delay cannot fit, Ice returns `verda_retry_deadline`
without sending an early retry. Backoff is interruptible; a GET can refresh an
expired token once. Resource mutations are still sent only once.

```sh
ice list --cloud verda --json
ice shell --cloud verda INSTANCE_UUID --print-creds --json
ice shell --cloud verda INSTANCE_UUID --print-creds --no-probe --json
ice push --cloud verda INSTANCE_UUID ./input /root/input --json
ice pull --cloud verda INSTANCE_UUID /root/results ./results --json
ice stop --cloud verda INSTANCE_UUID --timeout 2m --json
ice start --cloud verda INSTANCE_UUID --timeout 5m --json
ice delete --cloud verda INSTANCE_UUID --timeout 5m --json
```

List discovery shows Ice-prefixed hostnames. Explicit full resource IDs can
address other VMs in the project; only operate resources authorized for the task.
`--no-probe` reads connection metadata without starting the VM, probing SSH,
matching local keys, or requiring an installed SSH executable/local private key.
Transfers use rsync with protected arguments and require a running VM, SSH access
and rsync at both ends. Noninteractive connection lookup never starts a stopped VM.

## Workload boundary

Ice ends at provisioning, lifecycle, connection and transfer support. It does
not install CUDA, run Nsight Compute, select images for profiling, or declare a
GPU suitable for a particular workload. Perform those checks with your workload's
tools over the returned SSH connection. A successful SSH check proves access,
not application readiness.

The former `ice-tool/profiling/` probe has moved to the CUDA research project's
`evaluation/profiling/admission-probe/`. Its checked kernel, original CSV fixture,
validator and tests were preserved; historical captures remain in that project's
`results/profiling/`. No compatibility symlink or probe is shipped by Ice.

## Validation and references

```sh
cargo test -p ice-tool
```

Rust tests use an HTTP mock server and mocked provider executables. No rental or system package install
is required. This workspace may need the Ice-only dependency workaround described
in the repository's validation documentation when sibling crates are unavailable:
`bash scripts/check-cli.sh ice-tool test --offline`.
